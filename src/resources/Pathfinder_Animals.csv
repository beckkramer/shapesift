The DC the aspidochelone must exceed is 25, or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. Captivating Scent (Ex) An aspidochelone exudes intoxicating pheromones from its skin, causing nearby creatures to seek it out. Anyone within a 1-mile radius must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or feel inexplicably drawn toward the aspidochelone by the most direct route possible. This effect is not an overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based with a -10 penalty. Deep Sea Denizen (Ex) An aspidochelone can travel to extraordinary depths, and has adapted to the intense darkness and water pressure of the deep. It possesses darkvision with a range of 120 ft. and is immune to damage from water pressure. Hibernate (Ex) After gorging itself on innumerable tons of deep sea life and unfortunate travelers, an aspidochelone floats to the surface and goes into a deep hibernation with only its mottled back jutting from the waves. While hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island. A hibernating aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a rock or island. An aspidochelone rouses from its hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it. The save DC is Constituiton-based. Hibernation of Ages (Ex) An aspidochelone in hibernation continues to exude its captivating scent. Over time, birds attracted by the aspidochelone's pheromones come to roost on the whale, inadvertently bringing the seeds of small plants and shrubbery to grow in the cracks upon the aspidochelone's thick hide. The preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island. Thus, any aspidochelone who has spent more than 10 years hibernating gains an addition +10 bonus on its Stealth check to look like a natural island. Watery Grave (Ex) A startled aspidochelone descends rapidly into the depths of the sea, creating an undertow in the water that pulls creatures above the whale down with it. Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6 points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100 feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed.

It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Demolishing Attack (Ex) A ravener behemoth that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. Mighty Roar (Su) Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based. Rock Hurling (Ex) Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between 60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner. Shock Wave (Ex) As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down smaller creatures and creating di#cult terrain in a 100-foot radius centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based. Swallow Whole (Ex) A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.",camouflage,magical beast,,18,153600,,,,N,-2,,"35, touch 0, flat-footed 35","(-2 Dex, +35 natural, -8 size)",337,(25d10+200),regeneration 15 (electricity),"Fort +22, Ref +12, Will +12",22,12,12,,15/adamantine,"acid, curse effects, disease, mindaffecting effects, paralysis, poison, sonic","cold 20, fire 20",29,,,rock +16 (2d8+24),,,,,"Str 42, Dex 6, Con 26, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 14",,25,49,57 (61 vs. trip),"Awesome Blow, Cleave, Great Cleave, Greater Bull Rush, Greater Overrun, Greater Sunder, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Iron Will, Lunge, Power Attack, Snatch","Perception +17, Survival +14, Swim +28",,," any forest, hill, jungle, or plains",solitary or pair,Value standard,"The ground quakes as a colossal, elephantine beast of rocky, armored plates presses forward.

The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma's size, the oma takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check.  Carrier (Ex) A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself out and instead make a DC 20 Reflex save on its turn. Success allows the creature to move into the creature's larger second stomach, where it can ride safely for an indefinite period without taking damage. When a passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or make an additional DC 20 Reflex save to be safely excreted in an adjacent square. An oma's carrier stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size, so two Huge creatures, four Large, etc.). At its option, an oma can choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not the acid damage of the first stomach.  Starflight (Ex) An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two planets within a single solar system should take 3d20 days, while a trip to another solar system should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided the oma knows the way to its destination.","carrier, no breath, starflight",magical beast,,16,76800,,,,N,-2,,"30, touch 0, flat-footed 30","(-2 Dex, +30 natural, -8 size)",290,(20d10+180),,"Fort +23, Ref +10, Will +7",23,10,7,,,"cold, electricity, fire",,,,,,,,,,"Str 52, Dex 7, Con 29, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 5",,20,+49 (+53 grapple),57,"Awesome Blow, Critical Focus, Diehard, Endurance, Flyby Attack, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Staggering Critical, Vital Strike",Perception +24,,, vacuum and gas giants,"solitary, pair, or pod (3-6)",incidental,"This amorphous, whalelike creature floats ponderously, arcs of brilliant energy filling its mouth and rolling down its body.",,Distant Worlds,0,,,NULL,,NULL,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Powerful Leaper (Ex) The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump, and has a +24 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.  Regeneration (Ex) No form of attack can suppress the tarrasque's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If the tarrasque fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is inflicted upon its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but the method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.  Rush (Ex) Once per minute for 1 round, the tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. This increases its Acrobatics bonus on checks made to jump to +87.  Spines (Ex) The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail.

Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a bandersnatch's tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that creature must make a DC 28 Reflex save or a quill lodges in its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a bandersnatch with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d10 points of piercing damage from the bandersnatch's quills and suffers from the bandersnatch's pain attack.  Quick Recovery (Su) A debilitated bandersnatch recovers with frightening speed. If a bandersnatch starts its turn affected by any or all of the following conditions, these conditions end at the end of its turn: confused, dazed, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and stunned. Furthermore, a bandersnatch affected by ability damage, ability drain, or a mind-affecting effect that allows a save receives a single additional save against the effect of its choice at the original DC at the end of its turn in order to shake off the effect.  Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a bandersnatch can loose a volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

This fast healing applies only to damage inflicted on the hydra's body. Hydra Traits (Ex) A hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current HD. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties. Regenerate Head (Ex) When a hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra cannot have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously.

Deadly Bite (Ex) A jubjub bird applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack.

The hallucination element of this poison is mind-affecting. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Web Weaponry (Ex) A Leng spider is talented at using its webs to construct masterwork weapons. This technique of weapon creation allows the spider to effectively create a flail or bolas by attaching a heavy object such as a rock or chunk of metal to a cord of webbing. The spider attaches one end of this webbing to a leg and can then wield the weighted cord as a masterwork flail or a masterwork bolas. It can only wield one such weapon at a time-it must use its other legs to walk.

The gnoph-keh can place the center of this blizzard at any point within its reach. Multiple gnoph-kehs can use the aid another action to help a single gnoph-keh create a much larger blizzard-every additional gnoph-keh who aids the first increases the area of the blizzard's radius by 20 feet. All gnoph-kehs wishing to aid the primary creature must be within the area of that gnoph-keh's cold aura.  Once created, the blizzard remains active for 1 hour if it was created in a cold environment, or for 1 minute if created anywhere else. The wind in the blizzard's area blows in a clockwise circular pattern at windstorm speeds, restricts visibility as fog does, and makes the region count as difficult terrain. A gnoph-keh can move through a blizzard (either one created by magic or a naturally occurring blizzard) without penalty.  Cold Aura (Su) A gnoph-keh radiates an aura of blistering cold in a 30-foot radius. Any creature that ends its turn within this area takes 2d6 points of cold damage.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heat Susceptible (Ex) A gnoph-keh takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the effects of high temperatures (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). When a gnoph-keh takes damage from heat in this way, and the damage is from temperatures in excess of 90º F, the damage the creature takes is always lethal damage. In these conditions, the gnoph-keh's cold aura does not function at all.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the gnoph-keh climbs must be icy.

Enthralled creatures behave in one of the following four ways, which the siren chooses when she begins singing.  • Captivation: This functions exactly like a harpy's captivating song (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 172).  • Fascination: Affected creatures are fascinated.  • Obsession: An obsessed victim becomes defensive of the siren and does all he can to prevent harm from coming to her, going so far as attacking his allies in her defense.  The victim is not controlled by the siren, but views her as a cherished ally. This is a charm effect.  • Slumber: The victim immediately falls asleep, rendering the creature helpless. While the siren is singing, no noise will wake the sleeping creature, though slapping or wounding him does. The creature continues sleeping for 1d4 minutes after the siren stops singing, but can be awakened by loud noises or any other normal method.",,magical beast,,5,1600,,,,CN,3,,"18, touch 14, flat-footed 14","(+3 Dex, +1 dodge, +4 natural)",52,(8d10+8),,"Fort +7, Ref +11, Will +6",7,11,6,,,mind-affecting effects,,,,,,"Spell-Like Abilities (CL 7th; concentration +12)  3/day-cause fear (DC 16), charm person (DC 16), deep slumber (DC 18), shout (DC 19)",,,,"Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 19, Cha 21",,8,8,22,"Dodge, Flyby Attack, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Finesse","Fly +7, Knowledge (history) +10, Perception +15, Perform (sing) +13, Stealth +14",,"Auran, Common", temperate or warm hills,solitary or flight (2-7),standard,"This creature has the body of a hawk and the head of a beautiful woman with long, shining hair.",,PFRPG Bestiary 2,0,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Carbuncle,Tiny,20 ft.,bite +1 (1d2-3),specious suggestion,low-light vision,2-1/2 ft.,0 ft.,,"Empath (Su) Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy, allowing them to transmit mild impressions and remembered sensations to other creatures. This form of telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as by transmitting pain). A carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or the faint smell of leaves, but not directly warn an ally that it sees a monster or tell of a treasure under a pile of leaves. Fatal Faker (Su) As a standard action, three times per day, a carbuncle can teleport as per the spell dimension door, but only to a range of 30 feet. Upon teleporting, the carbuncle leaves behind a perfect replica of itself amid a colored flash and the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica duplicates the carbuncle in all ways, though it is obviously dead and the colorless stone in its head is reduced to worthless dust. For all other purposes, the body left behind is treated as though it were an item created by minor creation. Any attempt to heal or resurrect this “body” fails. Dispel magic and similar spells cause the body to vanish, though after 12 hours, the replica melts away into sweet-smelling ooze. Specious Suggestion (Su) As a standard action, three times per day, a carbuncle can concentrate intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt to impose its will upon the target. Carbuncles have difficulty forcing their wills upon non-carbuncles (and indeed carbuncles are immune to the suggestive powers of other carbuncles), resulting in one of the effects listed below. When using this ability a carbuncle must roll on the following chart. If it dislikes the result, it may make a DC 15 Wisdom check to add or subtract 1 from the result. If the ability check fails, the result changes opposite from the way intended. Targets may attempt to resist the negative effects of a carbuncle's suggestion by making a DC 12 Will save. The carbuncle need not share a language with its target to convey its suggestions. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Wisdom-based. 1d6 Carbuncle Suggestion 1 The carbuncle grants the target a flash of insight into the true future. The target gains a +2 bonus to its AC for the next round. 2 The target is alerted to dangers the carbuncle perceives. The target gains a +2 bonus on any initiative roll made in the next minute. 3 The carbuncle manifests a random image in the target's mind (usually of a food or strangely colored animal). This image lasts for only a moment and has no other effect. 4 The carbuncle's thoughts affect the target similarly to the spell suggestion, though the compulsion lasts for only 1 minute. 5 The carbuncle's thoughts garble those of its target. The target takes a -2 penalty on Will saves for the next round. 6 The carbuncle grants the target a vision of a false future. The target takes a -2 penalty to its AC for the next round. Vulnerability to Suggestion (Ex) Carbuncles prove highly vulnerable to spells with the mind-affecting descriptor.

This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat can immediately make a full attack against the spell's caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

(average)",touch +7 (attach),blood drain,"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, scent;  Perception +1",2-1/2 ft.,0 ft.,,"Attach (Ex) When a stirge hits with a touch attack, its barbed legs latch onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the stirge is removed.  Blood Drain (Ex) A stirge drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage. Once a stirge has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge's appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.  Diseased (Ex) Due to the stagnant swamps in which they live and their contact with the blood of numerous creatures, stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.",diseased,magical beast,,1/2,200,,,,N,4,,"16, touch 16, flat-footed 12","(+4 Dex, +2 size)",5,(1d10),,"Fort +2, Ref +6, Will +1",2,6,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Str 3, Dex 19, Con 10, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 6",,1,+3 (+11 grapple when attached),9 (17 vs. trip),Weapon Finesse,"Fly +8, Stealth +16",,, temperate and warm swamps,"solitary, colony (2-4), flock (5-8), storm (9-14), or swarm (15-40)",none,"This insectoid creature has two pairs of bat wings, a tangle of thin legs, and a needle-sharp proboscis.",,PFRPG Bestiary,0,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
